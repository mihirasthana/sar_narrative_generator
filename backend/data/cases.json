            "Investigation Summary": "Within personal savings account 204781000000; ACH deposits in the personal checking account consist of UPS Payroll, apple cash transfers, and Venmo cashouts PAP Zelle credits are remitted frequently varying in amounts from $2.00 to $6391.00, with multiple remittances being received on same days. Visa money deposits appear to be cash outs from cash app. Transfer credits are primarily remitted from Money Market savings account xxxx4533. RTP credits are minimal. Transfer debits are sent to savings account xxx4533 with amounts appearing reasonable for savings account funding purposes. ACH withdrawals consist of bill payments and PayPal transfers. PAP debits do not appear excessive in amount or volume. POS purchases are consistent with expected consumer expenses such as grocery, food and subscription services. RTP debits do not appear excessive for personal remittances. Unusual activity consists of 183 PAP Zelle Credits totaling $149,939.00, $103,370.58 in ACH deposits from external accounts (apple cash, cash app, venmo), VMRT C (15 totaling $10,669.70) and RTPC (1) of $759.48. Which appears excessive for the customer whose employer is listed as teacher/professor. The PAP crediting activity appears to lack transparency and is deemed unusual. There is no clear relationship to counterparties who are remitting the funds. Surrounding crediting activity will not be deemed unusual as funds appear to be transfers from external bank accounts and transfers from related savings account. Debiting activity will not be deemed suspicious as the primary use of funds is funding the customers related money market savings account xxxx9609 as well as POS purchases and ACH withdrawals consistent with expected consumer bill payments and spending. PAP debits do not appear excessive for personal remittances. In conclusion a SAR is recommended to report unusual ACH credits activity involving USB accounts 204781415920 and subjects Bryan W Gomez-Cuenca, Erin L Theesfield, Matti J Gomez-Cuenca, Plamen J Gomez Cuenca.
